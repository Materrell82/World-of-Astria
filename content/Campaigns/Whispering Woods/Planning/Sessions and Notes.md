# Session 19

## The Elderwood Archives

- After the party gets accustomed to their temporary living conditions they decide to head into the [[Elderwood Archives]]. The party finds [[Draven Elderwood]] at a table in the middle of the Library, very invested in whatever he is reading.

- As the party approaches he will respond to any questions without looking up from his reading material until his name is mentioned then he has the parties full attention.

- When people ask him about his inventions or magical innovations he is very ecstatic to share his knowledge and even take any critic or ideas.

- When seeing other peoples inventions he will ask if he can take a look at it and will either be very blunt if its poorly made or on how it can be upgraded.

- When he is looking for things in the library that are out of arms reach, he will create a portal to the location he is needing to be get what he is looking for and walk back through it.

### NOTES

- Jace meets Draven Elderwood at the Elderwood Archives next to their temporary home.
	- When first meeting Draven he is reading a book on ==Fey runes and sigils==, Jace is lost on what to do at first because of the contents of the archives and the barrier of language at first as Draven asks him questions in Lieren which Jace does not speak. As Draven realizes this he starts speaking common to Jace revealing he is fluent in the basics of common.
	- Draven shows off his portal magic capabilities using a item he made which is a bracelet covered in Fey runes that allows him to open portals within a certain distance from him that he can see or is familiar with.
	- Jace shows him his key that usually brings him to his workshop in Astria but it is blocked due to the difference in realms.
		- Draven takes him to his workshop area upstairs using his bracelet and helps Jace in making the key to work no matter what realm he is in using Fey runes that he used on the [[Fey Crossroads]]
		- Draven gives Jace a magical tool to make enchanting and adding runes to items easier.
		- After this Jace enters his workshop and shows Draven his own inventions and work as Draven did with him. They then spend a few hours sharing information and ideas going from workshop to workshop.

- Imira after having a talk with [[Erytos, God of Life]] and meeting with [[Ophelia, Guardian of the Forests]] in the dungeons has decided to give up her blood right to the title and power of Archfey to Kieran D'eldi. Made a magically binding contract for the safety of her, the party, and Ophelia from Kieran himself and those under his command. This contract also limited his power in Astria with boundaries on spreading territory using force, yet allowing him to expand through politics and treaties with other nations. 
	- ==Contract:
		- No harm comes to Imira or the rest of the party (Including Ophelia)
			- ==Stipulation:== They are not exempt from breaking laws and will be punished fairly if they are guilty. 
			- ==Stipulation:== They can not seek or accept any form of power in the Feywilde that would challenge that of the Archfey 
		- Kieran can not expand his territory by ==force== in Astria but he can expand his land through political means.
		- Imira can enter the feywilde anytime she pleases due to her blood relation. Officially making her a citizen of the Feywilde and Laeran. 

- Eryndor meets with his Patron [[Gaardauth, King of the Abyss]] after making it to their temporary home
	- Gaardauth is happy with what Eryndor has been able to do but the amount of power gained from him recently hasn't been as much lately.
	- Gaardauth presents Eryndor with a task to insert a fragment of his soul into the Tree of Life in Laeran so he can passively draw power from the Feywild, with the incentive that the power gained will be because of Eryndor, making his debt to him be paid faster
	- Eryndor is looking for a good place to put the soul fragment and has looked in the center of the city where the main roots of the tree are exposed, but hasn't made any moves on the plan yet. 

# Session 20

## The Ascension of Archfey Kieran

- After signing the Magically binding contract Kieran, has started preparations for the ceremony of ascension which is to take place mid-day in the throne room by a chosen of Erytos. To start the process of extracting the power from Imira into Kieran and the coronation of Kieran as Archfey.
	- Many high ranking individuals from Laeran will be in attendance, as well as those from other positions of high regard such as guild leaders.
	- The chosen will extract the essence of the Archfey from Imira and transfer it to Kieran. Imira will be left with the normal essence of Erytos lessening the strength of her power but she will still be able to use her magic but at a weakened state.
	- Imira will feel slightly drained and weakened but Kieran will feel the strongest he's ever felt with his new power. He will then go to the throne to finish his ascension into the Archfey.
	- He will then immediately after celebrating with those around him leave to go do planning and business he's been waiting to do.
- Gift to Jace from Draven
	- A bracelet that is identical to the one he owns
		- Bracelet Stats: Fey artifact that can open portals, On a bonus action you can open a portal to a spot you can see or are familiar with within 60ft of you. It stays open based on concentration, or you can close it on command.
	- The book of Fey Runes and Sigils
		- With a booklet teaching Lieren with a key to translate it to common.
	- A key similar to the one Jace has that opens up to the Elderwood Archives workshop
	- A note:
		- "It has been a pleasure to meet you, I hope to learn more through the mutual benefit of knowing you as a fellow inventor and a new friend. I've left you with a bracelet similar to mine that I thought would benefit you on your travels. I've also borrowed your design for a way to get to the Archive if you would ever need it or want to visit. I wish you well on whatever comes next for you." 

### NOTES

- As the day starts the party notices there is still no sign of Gideon as they all wake up but there is a note that was slid under the door. The note states that the Crowning ceremony of Archfey Kieran will be happening later that afternoon in the Throne room and Imira personally is a key part in it.

- The group decides to wait until close to the start of the ceremony to head to the elevator that leads to the Throne room. There are a significant crowd of people in the throne room of various status and attire. The group meets Silvia, one of Erytos' Chosen who will be conducting the ceremony.

- Imira is escorted to a small circle connected to a larger one where her right to the power of the Archfey is transferred to Kieran, making her lose some of her magic's strength and color but overall keeping her magic intact.

- Kieran was then crowned Archfey of the Feywild officially disconnecting Imira from the power of the Archfey.

- Ophelia was set free and Jace received a gift from Draven after talking to him about the changes to the artifact on his arm during the ceremony.
