### Backstory:

Liliana is 24 and was born into an upper middle class family in Eprosâ€¦ Her mother died when she was 7 and when her sister was four. Her father wasn't home often working long nights at the academy leaving liliana to take care of rose. When she was 19 she and her sister went outside of Epros to practice some magic where they were attacked by Husks; her sister died during this attack and was later turned into one. Liliana was attacked by her sister and received a scar on her right shoulder down to her hand she escaped her sister and ran home. Her father blames her for Rose's death. After Rose's death she began to spiral, skipping classes and doing generic delinquent shit. Her father was too occupied with teaching and grieving Rose's death to realize how far gone liliana was. At the age of 20 she dropped out of school and began frequenting bars and taverns drinking her sorrows. She met a man by the name of Isaac who helped her back on her feet. Convinced that there was more to her sister's death she begins her own detective agency with his help. 4 years later the curse reminds her of her sister and hits close to home so she begins to follow any leads she can on it. She has a theory that it could be foul play and thinks this may give her a lead on her sister's death as well.
