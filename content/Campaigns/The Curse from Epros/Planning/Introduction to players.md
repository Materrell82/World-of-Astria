# Curse of Parallax

## Lore

- A Curse has been released on the continent of Astria through what seemed to be a normal shipment of raw materials, artifacts, and items from the magical city Epros. This curse targets those with weaker cores allowing their body to undergo transformation at a faster rate. This transformation seems to be a type of creature resembling Husks but with a more abyssal nature, not needing the period of growth a normal husk would go through. Making them more volatile as they are able to spread this curse by attacking and infecting their victims.

- Some countries are quick to blame Epros for this spread due to it's nature and as it was said to come from their shipments.

- Epros denies these claims but due to the suspicion on their own part of where the source of this curse is coming from they have decided to close down their trade and strengthen their security at their border only allowing magical users of C grade or higher into the city due to the curse having less effect on those of that grade.

- Some see this as a way of hiding from their problems and feel they are hiding something behind their walls. The rivalry between the magical inept and those without has always been an issue, this event has only enhanced it. Some places are now going as far as banning magic users / certain magical items due to the fear of the curse affecting them.

## Session 0 / End of the Whispering Woods

- As the party leaves Laeran with [[Ophelia, Guardian of the Forests]] tagging along with them, their next step is to return home for Imira to have a proper burial for her parents and to finally release them from her mind.
	- If they first travel to Lightstar through Jace's door he will find a letter from one of his assistants on his desk telling him:
		- =="The last shipment from [[Epros]] was turned away at the border of Lighstar, I was told you would be getting a refund for the supplies you ordered within the coming week. Unfortunately shipments from Epros will no longer be accepted for the time being due to recent events in Astria. Sorry for the Inconvenience. - Collie"== 
		- Due to not being able to use his own mana effectively for his creations this is a big hit to Jace's business, once he runs out of his current supplies he won't be able to make his inventions to the level he currently is able to.
		- If they investigate further into the matter they learn more about the outbreak of the curse and find out that Locern and some surrounding cities were affected the most from the curse as news of it spread quickly hoping to limit the damage. Some countries faired better than others.
		- Locern is trying to convince others into a full investigation of Epros for what has happened to them, threatening a possible conflict if there is not a sufficient outcome.
- As they arrive in [[Hideguard]] they will notice fliers hanging up from Epros noting that they are increasing the requirements of entry and putting a full halt on trading outside of their surrounding territory.
- Ask Imira (Kait) where and how she would want to do the burial for her parents, can be basic or include Ophelia in the ceremony using her fey magic.
- If [[Eryndor]] asks about / talks to his patron [[Gaardauth, King of the Abyss]], he will want Eryndor to investigate more if he can but if not he will not push further now that he is a free man.
- ==Ask the party what they would want to do now :)))==
