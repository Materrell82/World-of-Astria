# Magical Cores

- Every living thing is born with a magical core within their body. These cores passively gather and absorb raw mana out of the surrounding area.

- There are multiple stages called awakenings that increase the efficacy and potency of the cores allowing the user to use the raw magic they absorb.

## Unawakened Cores

- Gathers very low amounts of raw mana if any at all from the surrounding area. Most common core to be born with especially in lower magical areas in the world. If exposed to a consistent flow or large wave of raw mana can cause an awakening in the core to a Half-awakened core.

## Half-awakened Cores

- Gathers a good amount of mana from the surrounding area can be harder in low magical areas. Rare to be born with but is more common in higher magical areas or in bloodlines who have half or fully awakened cores.

- Can channel their mana through their body but can not manifest it out of their body due to them not having full control of the raw magic in their core. They can use this channeling of magic to activate magical items and weapons that have been engraved with magical runes.

- A massive wave of raw magic or staying in a very potent area of raw mana can heighten the process of allowing the core to be fully awakened. There is also another method of over stressing the core with raw magic or pushing it to past it's limit. This can be a forced evolution or can cause the core to rupture leaving the user without the ability to use magic or can even kill the user.

## Fully-awakened Cores

- Gathers high to extreme amounts of raw mana from the surrounding area, practically impossible to recover used mana in low magic areas. Many fully-awakened casters will use mana crystals or other mana storage items to regain their mana reserves quickly especially in lower magic areas. Extremely rare to be born with even in high magic areas but is not as unreachable in higher areas.

- Stronger users that have fully-awakened cores need to control their passive aura of magical pressure or it can effect those who have a weaker core around them. Causing them to become nauseous or even cause them to faint due to the overwhelming pressure.

- There is no known awakening phase past this point but if a user uses their power often and stays in high magical areas their magic ability has been seen to improve and grow stronger overtime. There is a higher limit but there is still a chance to push the core past it's limit causing the core to rupture.

## Types of Fully-Awakened Magical Cores

### Raw Magic Cores

- The most common core that most are born within Astria due to the presence of Raw Magic being the most prevalent on the continent within settled areas. Raw magic is considered the most basic and neutral form of magic with no sentience or alignment attached to it.

### Radiant Magic Cores

- This core gives the user access to Radiant specific magics, if the user has a different core this replaces the original core entirely, they lose their ability to use magics they had access to using a raw magic core. The magic granted has the ability of manipulating their magic into pure light which has the properties of healing and burn light, allowing them to be a pivotal ally and a strong warrior against the darkness in the world.

- Any raw magic that is absorbed is converted into Radiant magic, this process is slower than gathering radiant magic causing a downside to using this magic without reserves in low magic or other magical areas.

- Some creatures are born with this core due to their area being rich in radiant magic while others are gifted this core by entities with immense radiant magic through worship and/or contractual agreements. 
### Fey Magic Cores

- This core gives the user access to Fey specific magics, this replaces the original core entirely if the user previously had another core. The magic granted has the ability of manipulating plants, animals, and other factors of nature. Allowing them to have magical beasts under there command and use the environment around them to catch their enemies off guard.

### Abyssal Magic Cores 


## Large Magical Beasts

- Larger magical beasts can have multiple cores and/or larger cores allowing them more potential for heightened magical power and a increased amount they are able to hold onto and use at one time.

- These beast are usually found in very potent magical areas due to their need for large amounts of mana.
