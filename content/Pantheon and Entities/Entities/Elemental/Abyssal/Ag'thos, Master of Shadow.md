[[Abyssal]]
- One of the elite abyssal entities who hold power on Astria, after the Eclipse ended Agâ€™thos lost their power over most of the pawns they obtained over the years of darkness with the boost of power the Eclipse gave them.

- His goal is to gain the control he held during the eclipse or at least get the most he can out of it. He still has the power he held personally but he feels it's useless without others to command.

- Since then he has been looking for those in need to contract or pact with to accomplish his goals with less effort and without personally involving himself with other entities and creatures in the way.

- His goal is to absorb the souls of other abyssal entities to be able to ascend to become one of the abyssal gods of the continent.
