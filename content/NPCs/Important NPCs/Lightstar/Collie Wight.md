### Collie Wight
- Location: [[Lightstar]]
- A promising young Artificer who is the apprentice and friend of [[Campaigns/The Curse from Epros/Players/Jace Seastrider|Jace Seastrider]].
- She specializes in prosthesis and enchantment of clothing / armor
- Collie runs the storefront and main workshop of the location in Lightstar for Jace, and has been for last couple years.
- Jace initially dismissed the idea of taking someone as his apprentice due to him believing he had too much left to learn to even begin to teach effectively. However after Collie convinced him into hiring her as a helping hand in Lightstar, she slowly worked her way into an apprenticeship even though Jace feels she is talented enough to not need him. This has led to a situation where Jace considers her more as an equal than an apprentice but Collie feels she still has a lot left to learn.
