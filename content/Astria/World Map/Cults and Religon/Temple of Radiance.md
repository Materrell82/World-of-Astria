## - Current standing in society
- Seen as an old way of life that many no longer have the drive to pursue

- The current members of the Monastery are Elder Monks and few who have taken the path and have accepted the Blessing of Light.

## - The Blessing of Light
- When a monk chooses to be fully devoted to the monastery and [[Myra, Goddess of Light and Healing]], a ritual is performed to make the transition into one of the Blessed.

- The chosen is surrounded by Elders and/or blessed monks while standing on a circle made of sandstone representing the sun, the more monks present the higher chance that the ritual is successful. The monks then start to chant the ritual in celestial, which will cause a beam of light to strike the chosen burning their skin. The beam stays active for 10 minutes and the chosen must endure the pain. There is a possibility of death and worse to be forever scarred and unworthy of the blessing.
