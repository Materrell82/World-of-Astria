# *Order of Goran - -  Slayers*

- A militaristic force built high in the mountains within the fiery peaks which contains a slightly active volcano. This organization was created to deal with the increasing threat of husks and other magical threats growing on the continent, and became the leading force during the eclipse against what hid in the dark.

- A task force of Goran elite and volunteers of others on the continent were the ones to confront the cult at their base of operations and end the eclipse. They ended up losing most of the task force leaving 3 alive, 2 being Goran members.

# *Slayers*

- A specially trained group within the Order that specialize in hunting and “slaying” husks and other magical creatures that are considered a threat. They are usually brought in when they are very young but can be added in during dire circumstances (Eclipse). They usually travel in pairs as a Guardian and a Mage, a physical force and a magical one so they can cover each other's weaknesses. 

- Slayers are taught the weaknesses and abilities of husks and creatures that have been registered into Goran's database of encountered beasts and monsters. Slayers have specialized armor and weapons that are an order secret on how they are made. The metal is an alloy “Malkite” made from a metallic resource found in the nearby volcano in the fiery peaks. It also has a high affinity with magic making enchanting it easier and creating a stronger magical bond.

- The Slayers are run by Henry Galladan, headmaster of the Slayers. Last of the original Slayers, very well known and respected amongst the warriors across the continent especially those who met him during the Eclipse. Involved in all Slayer’s training and their acceptance as a Slayer.
