# Druids - - Lirien

- A group of very knowledgeable fey-touched humanoids that are known to be protectors and caretakers of the wilds in Astria. They speak with fey entities and gods through visions and on rare occasions will appear in a physical form in urgent cases.

- Druids wear a variety of furs, feathers, pelts, trinkets, bones, etc. that they have foraged themselves from nature, traditionally even painting symbols and marks on their face and body to represent their connection with the higher power.

## Potion Brewing / Rituals 

- Druids specialize in potion craft to create a variety of concoctions to deal with problems or give them enhanced abilities. Such as potions to enhance stamina, perception, or strength. Also making more practical potions that can heal faster than normal medicine or remove curses or disease within an hour. 

### - Blood Rituals / Sacrifices

- Druids can make special concoctions that are poisonous to most but after building up a tolerance as a novice druid the process becomes just a slightly uncomfortable experience instead that allows them to tap into the spirit world and draw power from it to create stronger potions or interact with spirits for signs / visions. This can be dangerous since what comes out of the spirit world is not under the Druids control, risking the introduction of shades or other misleading spirits. into their mind.
    
- Most rituals use animal or human blood (Druid code requires it to be consented blood) usually from the druid themselves with a mix of other herbs to make the concoction for the ritual.
    

## Animal Companions

- Due to druids' tendency to wander the land they usually find company in animal companions that they either raised or saved on their journey.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/20wgm2nTXxyQgA8UA7A3UGN3JUWE8W0lefvjKUb8lRmIfy2ATTXaNU5YoNsnJ3eOdLo2WUjXSvA5x0FILZYImly_vWPLcyb4f2r1zUYVjH66BMGX6dtQH0QV0xbNETCPol1FcV272mPJdycOAebCkAM)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-wWNI-T2PSQao7YYMRCwYMqYwHiwFvon6I2tg4ga245V7q_faylLt8I8TzY4mOmazr074mvG8xhXaYQYZgHyRo1RbVeFEjh5dR1rruu4HeHvllZgzQyoaNGnVKYV9b5-aAwHCMAppbUEpnHHOche4LY)
